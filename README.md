This game is an entry to Ludum Dare 39. 

## Setup

There's some steps to get working on this project: 

First, clone the repository:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/monochromicon/ludum-dare39.git
```

Then, get started with NPM: 

```shell
# Install dependencies
cd ludum-dare39
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Or perhaps, with Yarn:

```shell
# Install dependencies
cd ludum-dare39
yarn

# Start the dev server at http://localhost:3000
yarn dev
```


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
